# An Interactive Node-Link Visualization of Convolutional Neural Networks
### [Adam Harley](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/)
Convolutional neural networks are at the core of state-of-the-art approaches to a variety of computer vision tasks. Visualizations of neural networks typically take the form of static node-link diagrams, which illustrate only the structure of a network, rather than the behavior. Motivated by this observation, this project presents a new interactive visualization of neural networks trained on handwritten digit recognition, with the intent of showing the actual behavior of the network given user-provided input. The user can interact with the network through a drawing pad, and watch the activation patterns of the network respond in real time.
